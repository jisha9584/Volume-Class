# CSE-231-Project-11

**Overview**
<br>
This project introduces a Python Volume class, designed to handle volumes with units in milliliters (ml) and ounces (oz). It is a versatile tool for managing and converting volume measurements, suitable for various applications where volume calculations are essential.

<br>

**Features**
<br>
1. **Volume Object Initialization:** Initialize volume objects with a magnitude and unit.
2. **String Representations:** Custom string (__str__) and representation (__repr__) methods for displaying volume objects.
3. **Unit Conversion:** Convert volumes between metric (ml) and customary (oz) units.
4. **Volume Validity:** Check if a volume object is valid with predefined units.
5. **Comparison Support:** Compare two volume objects for equality.
6. **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition and subtraction of volume objects or with numeric values.

<br>

**Usage**
<br>
1. **Creating Volume Objects:** Instantiate a volume object with magnitude and unit (e.g., Volume(100, 'ml')).
2. **Converting Units:** Use metric() and customary() methods to convert between ml and oz.
3. **Performing Calculations:** Add or subtract volume objects or numeric values using add() and sub() methods.
4. **Comparing Volumes:** Compare two volume objects for equality using the == operator.
5. **Displaying Volume:** Print volume objects to see their magnitude and unit.

<br>

**Requirements**
<br>
Python 3.x

<br>

**Ideal For**
<br>
Developers or students working with volume measurements in applications like cooking, laboratory work, or any scenario requiring volume manipulations.
Those learning about object-oriented programming concepts in Python, especially class design, method overriding, and operator overloading.
